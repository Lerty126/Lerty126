# 1st Year
### Implementation of a Client Requirement
The aim of this project was to design a small game inspired by Timeline. It was supposed to consist of a timeline with events to be placed in the correct order.

It was done in pairs; I was in charge of the design part, while my colleague took care of testing.

### Development of an Application
The goal of this project was to design and improve a small game, in iterations of 4 hours, with a strong emphasis on the design aspect (class diagram, sequence diagram, testing, group organization, strategy, etc.).

It was done in groups of 4; we divided the work into pairs (each pair had to choose two features, each pair took one and carried out its design, implementation, and verification).

### Comparison of Algorithmic Approaches
This project aimed to encourage us to compare algorithms. I had to compare two implementations of lists (linked lists and contiguous lists) to see which one performed better for certain operations and quantities.

It was done in pairs, and I mainly worked on the final output and the implementation of the two types of lists (the work was done with my partner!).

### Network and Server Application
In this project, we had to create a "pseudo-bash" on Linux, which is a command interpreter. We had to create it in C, along with a video demonstrating how it works. In a second part, we saw how the deployment (at least, between two local machines) of a .deb package, created by us, containing our "pseudo-bash" was done.

It was done by two people; my partner took care of most of the application development, while I handled the package's security (with encrypted keys) and its deployment.

# 2nd Year
### Creation of a PHP Website (NetVOD)
Project done by 4 members, creating a website in PHP similar to Netflix, aiming to understand how the language works.

Handling passwords, database management (PDO), and the implementation of videos and CSS in a PHP website were covered.

### Creation of a Java Introspection Application
Project done by 4 members, creating an application that uses the Java class introspection mechanism to recreate a program similar to the one included in Eclipse for class diagram generation.

# 3rd Year
### Administration of a Web Server
Project done by 3 members, the goal was to set up several services (Keycloak, Nextcloud, Lstu, Oauth2, and OpenLDAP), all on an Nginx server.

The aim was to see how these services communicated securely with each other and to manage authentication with an LDAP server.

### Supervised Project: Monitoring and Log File Analysis Solution
Ongoing project with 4 members. We have to set up 2 Docker clusters, one for monitoring and the other for services to be monitored.

We are using several monitoring solutions:
- Grafana
- Prometheus
- cAdvisor

And several log file analysis solutions:
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- Filebeat

The goal is to send all errors in the logs to a language model to process the error and provide us with the solution, thanks to a Python program.
