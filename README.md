### Who am I?
Hello! </br>

I'm Noah "Lerty" MANDLER, currently a student in **3rd year of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** at IUT Nancy-Charlemagne, specializing in **DACS (Development of Communicating and Secure Applications)**. I joined this program after two years of studying Life Sciences at the Faculty of Sciences and Technologies in Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy.

I chose to **switch to Computer Science** because it has always interested me, even though I don't consider these two years in Biology wasted.

My main goal was to work in the **video game industry as a developer**, a goal fully supported by my brother, who motivated me to make this career change! However, as the preceding semesters progressed, I found myself more interested in specializing in system and network administration, a field that equally fascinates me.

### My educational background
I currently hold a **Baccalauréat S specializing in Life Sciences**. There was indeed an option for "Innovation and Digital Creation" that I considered taking, but it was more geared towards students in Engineering Sciences.

Following that and my **growing interest** in **biology**, I went to university to pursue a **degree** in this field. Unfortunately, due to the cold atmosphere of lectures (and university degrees in general) and the transition to online classes, I quickly decided to redirect myself towards my **true passion**, where I am currently.

Now that I am here, **I intend to make the most of it**, especially with the return of in-person classes and the proximity to professors.

### My education
As mentioned earlier, I am currently specializing in **system and network administration**. The aim of this program is to learn about **system architecture**, particularly **Debian** and its derivatives, as well as the functioning of **networks** and their **protocols**.

Of course, it's not just that; we study **virtualization**, **cloud computing**, script development (Ruby/Bash), all while refining our soft skills.

Initially somewhat hesitant, I have thoroughly enjoyed this program, and I absolutely do not regret this choice. Despite a very basic fourth semester, the depth that the third year has brought has greatly enhanced my appreciation for this education.
